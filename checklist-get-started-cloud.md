## Set up accounts and enterprises
{: #account-enterprise}

This checklist is for administrators who are responsible for creating and setting up an account structure in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and enabling users within their company to create and manage cloud resources. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offers you the ability to create a stand-alone account and an enterprise.

Stand-alone account
:   This type of account allows an account owner, for example a department or business unit administrator to add users to the account, assign access roles and permissions, manage billing and payments, and more.

Enterprise
:   An enterprise manages the billing for the entire company, with usage costs from multiple accounts being rolled up and paid for from the enterprise account. Accounts that are created as part of an enterprise are just like stand-alone accounts, but the main difference is that these accounts don't manage their own billing or payments.

Use the following checklist to track all of the tasks to create and configure your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account or enterprise. 

| Task | Description |
|---|-------------|
| - [ ] **What's in an account?**  | Your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account includes many interacting components and systems for resource, user, and access management. Understanding concepts like how certain components are connected or how access works help you effectively set up your account. For more information, see [What's in an account](/docs/account?topic=account-overview). |
| - [ ] **Determine if you need an enterprise** | When you create an enterprise to manage your billing, you can move existing stand-alone accounts to it, or create new accounts as needed. Consider the following when determining whether you need an enterprise or a stand-alone account: \n * In an enterprise, subscription discounts and cloud credits are available to all accounts that are in the enterprise. \n * Stand-alone accounts control their own billing. If your company is globally distributed, you might have a mix of multiple enterprises and stand-alone accounts to support regional billing requirements. \n \n Review the [What is an enterprise?](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise) documentation to determine whether you need an enterprise. |
| - [ ] **Create and configure your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account** | Even if you plan on using an enterprise, you need to create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. You can create your account by going to the [account registration](/registration) page and providing an email address and other additional information. The email address that is used to register becomes the account owner, but you can change this if required later on by following the steps in [Transferring ownership of your account](/docs/account?topic=account-transfer&interface=ui). \n \n If you have a Google account, you can use your Google credentials to create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account from the [account registration](/registration) page. For more information, see [Using a Google ID](/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started#signup-google). \n \n When setting up an account for your company or organization, it is best to use a functional ID, some teams call them service accounts, associated with your company. Keep in mind that you will need to monitor for automated emails sent to this email address for warnings about service usage, services being deprecated, new services available, and more. \n \n When you log in to the account for the first time, you are required to provide a credit card or subscription code to complete your account set up. Later, you can add users by inviting them to the account or by federating to your own corporate directory. \n \n Users that are added to your account are not required to create their own account. \n \n For more account-related FAQs, visit [FAQ library for managing your account, resources, and access](/docs?tab=faqs&tags=account). |
| - [ ] **Set up SAML federation** | By default, when you create an account you use an IBMid for user identity. IBMid is the ID as a Service (IDaaS) from {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} used to access {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} web-based services, including {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. The IBMid is based on your company's email address and a password that is managed by IBMid. IBMid allows you to federate to your own corporate directory or a third-party Identity Provider (IdP) service that you might already be using such as Okta. \n \n Federating to your own directory simplifies the process of adding users to your account as they will not require an IBMid with a separate password. However, there are cases where it might not be feasible for you to use IBMid federated to your corporate directory. \n \n An alternative is to create an [{{site.data.keyword.appid_long_notm}}](https://www.ibm.com/products/app-id){: external} instance in your account and connect it to your chosen identity provider. \n \n Consider the following options that are available to you: \n * **No federation**: Your company email domain is not federated with IBMid, and you choose to keep it as is. Any user that uses your email domain can create their own IBMid, and the password they create is managed by IBMid. They can invite other users with an IBMid to their {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. \n * **Federate with IBMid**: If your company's email domain is already federated, you can start configuring access to your account. If it is not already federated, a manual process with the IBMid federation team is required to establish federation. The decision to federate to your company's own directory needs to involve the person in your company that can make company-wide decisions when it comes to connecting to external parties for identity services. You need to ensure that this person is included in the process. Federating with IBMid can have an impact on web services that your company already uses with {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. \n * **Federate with {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} and your IdP**: This option requires the creation of an {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} instance. It is a self-service option with a low-usage fee. Choosing this option requires a custom URL to log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. In addition, an {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} instance and configuration of the federation to your IdP is required for every {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. \n \n For a deeper dive, use the following guides and documentation:  \n \n * [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} SAML Federation Guide](https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-cloud-saml-federation-guide/){: external}  \n \n * [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} login sequences](/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started#signup-federated). \n \n Use the following documentation topics when you are ready to federate: \n * [IBMid Enterprise Federation Adoption Guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ief){: external} \n \n * [Enable authentication from an external identity provider using {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}](/docs/account?topic=account-idp-integration). |
| - [ ] **Activate a subscription code** | With an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} subscription, you get discounted usage for platform services and support by committing to a minimum spending commitment for a certain period of time. After you buy a subscription for platform or support credit, you must add the credit to your account by applying a subscription code to your stand-alone account or enterprise. Applying the code ensures that the credit is added to your account, and you don't have unexpected overage charges. Make sure to add any purchased subscriptions to your account before creating resources. For more information, see [applying subscription codes](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscription_code). |
| - [ ] **Create and configure an enterprise**  | When you create an enterprise, the account that you used to initiate the process is automatically added to the enterprise, and a new enterprise account is created to manage the billing for the enterprise. Follow the steps in the [Setting up an enterprise](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-enterprise-tutorial) documentation to create an enterprise. Keep in mind that when using an enterprise, users within each account in the enterprise can create, use, and collaborate on resources just as they can in a stand-alone account. |
| - [ ] **Assign enterprise access to users** | If you chose to create an enterprise, you might require that administrators manage the enterprise performing functions, such as creating account groups, creating and managing accounts. Review the access that is required, and add users as needed. For more information, see [Assigning access for enterprise management](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-assign-access-enterprise). |
| - [ ] **Create resource groups** | Use resource groups to organize an account's resources for access control and billing purposes. For example, creating a resource group per project allows costs to be tracked at the project level even when your resources are distributed across regions. Learn more from the [What makes a good resource group strategy?](/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup#resource-group-strategy) best practices guide, and when you are ready, [create your resource groups](/docs/account?topic=account-rgs). |
| - [ ] **Set up email notification preferences** | Depending on your account type, you can choose to receive email notifications about {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform-related items such as announcements, billing and usage, additional notification preferences and ordering. You can update your preferences to receive email notifications about resource related, these notifications are for only the  resources you use. For more. For more information, see [Setting email preferences for notifications](/docs/account?topic=account-email-prefs). |

## Secure your account and resources
{: #securing}

As an account owner or a user in the account with the required access roles that are assigned for managing account settings and IAM access for users, you can complete tasks on the following checklist. Review and complete the following tasks to learn about how you can ensure the security of your account and resources.

| Task | Description |
|---|-------------|
| - [ ] **Set up multifactor authentication** | Multifactor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring all users to authenticate by using an extra authentication factor beyond an ID and password. This is also commonly known as two-factor authentication (2FA). \n \n Review the [types of multifactor authentication](/docs/account?topic=account-types) that can be enabled for your account. \n Follow the steps in [enabling MFA for your account](/docs/account?topic=account-enablemfa) to configure the setting that is most appropriate for your company.|
| - [ ] **Identity and Access Management (IAM) overview** | Learn about what {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM is, how IAM works, what features are available, and how to access the console, CLI, and APIs to work with IAM in your account. Learn more about [how {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM works](/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview). |
| - [ ] **Track your account activities by setting up an {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance** | You can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service to track how users and applications interact with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that you have created. Follow the instructions in [Provisioning an {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instance](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-provision) to create an instance in your wanted cloud region. \n \n For environments seeking to maintain [**Financial Services Validated**](/docs/account?topic=account-enabling-fs-validated) status on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you should instead follow the instructions in [Use Activity Tracker Event Routing](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-getting-started). You must create an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service in the Frankfurt (eu-de) region to start tracking IAM events. Learn more about the [auditing events](/docs/account?topic=account-acct_iam_tracking) that are sent to that region. |
| - [ ] **Configure streaming of {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} (optional)** | You can stream data from an {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance to another {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance across regions or to other corporate tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools. Learn more about [streaming data](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-streaming). |
| - [ ] **Secure your resources with context-based restrictions** | Context-based restrictions give account owners and administrators the ability to define and enforce access restrictions for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources based on the network location of access requests. These restrictions work with traditional IAM policies, which are based on identity, to provide an extra layer of protection. Since both IAM access and context-based restrictions enforce access, context-based restrictions offer protection even in the face of compromised or mismanaged credentials. \n \n Learn more about [what context-based restrictions are](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-whatis) and follow the guide to [secure your resources using context-based restrictions](/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-tutorial). |
| - [ ] **Encrypt and protect your data**  | You can choose from various secrets management and data protection products that help you to protect your sensitive data and centralize your secrets. Review [Which data protection service is best for me?](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-manage-secrets-ibm-cloud#which-data-protection-service) to better understand the different offerings that you can use with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} to protect your application secrets. Use the following guides to create and configure your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance: \n * [Store your secrets in a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-create-instance). \n * [Encrypt your data with {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-provision). \n * [Encrypt your data with {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-provision). |
| - [ ] **Security and compliance** | {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides a secure cloud platform that you can trust. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} compliance results from a platform and services that are built on best-in-industry security standards, including GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, PCI, SOC2, and others. For more information, see [Understanding compliance in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/overview?topic=overview-compliance). |

## Manage billing and usage
{: #billing-usage}

Account owners and users with the administrator role on the [billing account management service](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services&interface=ui#billing-acct-mgmt) have access to monitor and manage billing, usage, invoices, payments, and more. Complete the following checklist to get familiar with the best practices and tools that you use to manage and track billing and usage in the account.

| Task | Description |
|---|-------------|
| - [ ] **How to manage billing and usage** |  Learn about the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} billing options and tools that you can use to track your usage and manage invoicing and payments. Check out the [How can I manage billing and usage in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview) video. |
| - [ ] **Understand suspended billing on {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}}**  | Suspended billing is an option that is available for virtual server instances running on VPC. It is not available for bare metal or dedicated hosts on VPC. With suspended billing, there are some resources, for example network and storage that continue billing. Learn more about [suspended billing for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-suspend-billing). |
| - [ ] **Configure spending alerts for your account** |  You can enable spending notifications for Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription accounts, these alerts are configurable for the entire account or for individual services. [Set up spending notifications](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending). |
| - [ ] **Manage subscriptions and usage** | Setting up a subscription is covered in [Set up accounts and an enterprise checklist](#table2-accounts). You can add more subscriptions and monitor subscription usage on the Commitments and subscriptions page in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. Learn more about [managing subscriptions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions). |
| - [ ] **Manage commitments, subscriptions, and usage**  | Setting up a commitment or subscription is covered in Set up accounts and an enterprise checklist. You can add more commitments or subscriptions as well as monitor usage on the Commitments and Subscriptions page in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. Learn more about [Enterprise Savings Plan](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-committed-use) and [Managing subscriptions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions). |
| - [ ] **View invoices and build your own reports**  | To manage and view your invoices, visit the [Invoices](/billing/invoices) page from the billing and usage dashboard in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

## Connect your network to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #network}

As the need for global reach and 24/7 operations of web applications increases, the need to host services in multiple cloud data centers increases too. Data centers across multiple locations provide resilience in the case of a geographic failure and bring workloads closer to globally distributed users, which reduces latency and increases perceived performance. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network enables users to link workloads hosted in secure private networks across data centers and locations. Use the following checklist to review the available options and to connect your existing on-premises environments to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

| Task | Description |
|---|-------------|
| - [ ] **Enable virtual routing and forwarding (VRF)** | Dispersed cloud resources are resources in more than one location or in more than one subnet or VLAN. These types of resources require a routing function to communicate among themselves, even within a private network context. New accounts that are created in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} have a "multiple isolation" tenancy communication option, which is often called a customer VRF, enabled. Verify that it is enabled in your account, or enable it after confirming potential service disruptions if you have existing resources in your account. Follow the steps in the [Enabling VRF in the console](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#vrf) documentation. |
| - [ ] **Enable service endpoints** | It is also recommended to enable your account for using service endpoints. When {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoints are enabled in your account, you can choose to expose a private network endpoint when you create a resource. You can then connect directly to this endpoint over the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network rather than the public network. Because resources that use private network endpoints don't have an internet-routable IP address, connections to these resources are more secure. Follow the steps that are outlined in [Enabling service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#service-endpoint). |
| - [ ]  **Determine the interconnectivity solution for you** | Virtual Private Networking (VPN) access enables you to manage all servers and services that are associated with your account, remotely, over the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network. Depending on the infrastructure that you plan to use in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, there are a few options available for VPN: \n * [VPN for classic infrastructure](/docs/iaas-vpn?topic=iaas-vpn-getting-started) \n * [Client-to-site VPN for VPC infrastructure](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-overview) \n * [Site-to-site VPN for VPC infrastructure](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn) \n \n {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} is an alternative to a traditional site-to-site VPN solution. It can provide higher-throughput connectivity between a remote network and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environments. Use this decision tree to help you decide which {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} solution works best for you. For more information, see [How do I know which Direct Link solution to order?](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-direct-link#get-started-solution-to-order)    |
| - [ ] **About {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} (2.0)** | {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} offerings provide connectivity from an external source into a customer's {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network. {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} can be viewed as an alternative to a traditional site-to-site VPN solution, which is designed for customers that need more consistent, higher-throughput connectivity between a remote network and their {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environments. When selecting to use {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}, it is recommended that most customers choose {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} 2.0. [Learn more about {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} (2.0)](/docs/dl?topic=dl-dl-about). |
| - [ ] **Order {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Dedicated**  | Allows customers to terminate a single-tenant, fiber-based cross-connect into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network. This offering can be used by customers with colocation premises that are next to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} PoPs and data centers, as well as network service providers that deliver circuits to customer on-premises or other data centers. For more information, see [Ordering {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Dedicated](/docs/dl?topic=dl-how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-dedicated). |
| - [ ] **Order {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Connect** | Offers private access to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure and to any other clouds linked to your service provider through your local {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center. This option is perfect for creating multi-cloud connectivity in a single environment. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} connects customers to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network, by using a shared bandwidth topology. As with all {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} products, you can add global routing that enables private network traffic to all {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} locations. For more information, see [Ordering {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} Connect](/docs/dl?topic=dl-how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-connect). |
| - [ ] **Identify potential conflicts with the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} network reserved IPs (applicable to {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} 1.0 only)** | When selecting to use {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}, it is recommended that most customers choose {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} 2.0, since it provides more options and flexibility. If you have a real need for {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} 1.0, make sure to review the list of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} network reserved IPs that might conflict with your on-premises environment. Review [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IP ranges](/docs/cloud-infrastructure?topic=cloud-infrastructure-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges). |
| - [ ] **Coordinate with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Design Engineering when you have special requirements** | If you are planning on using any of the following: GRE or IPsec tunnels, BCR pairing, multi VLAN tenants, custom inbound or outbound ACLs, ASN pre-pend, and static routes, open a support case and request assistance from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Design Engineering to confirm that your requirements are in line with your {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} selections. |

## Enable logging and monitoring
{: #observability}

Analyze logs, collect metrics, and configure near real-time alerts on your cloud resources and applications.

| Task | Description |
|---|-------------|
| - [ ] **Create platform logs**   | You can use {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} to manage operating system logs, application logs, and platform logs in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Platform logs are logs that are exposed by enabled services and the platform in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You must configure a logging instance in a region to monitor these logs. Learn more about [configuring {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} platform logs](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-config_svc_logs). |
| - [ ] **Create a dedicated logging instance (optional)** | {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} offers administrators, DevOps teams, and developers advanced features to filter, search, and tail log data, define alerts, and design custom views to monitor application and system logs. Learn more about [getting started with {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}}](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-getting-started). |
| - [ ] **Configure streaming of {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}}** | You can stream data from an {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} instance to another {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} instance across regions or to other corporate tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools. Learn more about [streaming data](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-streaming). |
| - [ ] **Configure logging agent** | The logging agent collects and forwards logs to your {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} instance. After you provision an {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} instance, you must configure a logging agent for each log source, for example in classic infrastructure or VPC infrastructure, that you want to monitor. Learn more about [logging agents](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-log_analysis_agent). |
| - [ ] **Configure {{site.data.keyword.monitoringshort_notm}}** | {{site.data.keyword.monitoringlong_notm}} is a cloud-native, and container-intelligence management system that you can include as part of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} architecture.

## Streamline access management with identities, groups, and policies
{: #users-groups}

Use the following checklist to create user and service identities in your accounts. Then, create access and resource groups for organizing users and resources to streamline the access management process. Account owners or users with the administrator role on all [IAM account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services&interface=ui#all-iam), which includes services such as the user management, access groups, identity service, and more can complete these tasks.

| Task | Description |
|---|-------------|
| - [ ] **Create access groups** | Access groups are used to organize a set of users and service IDs into a single entity to enable the assignment of policies to the group instead of assigning the same access multiple times per individual user or service ID. A logical way to assign access to resource groups is by creating one access group per required level of access. Then, each access group is mapped to the needed resource groups. Examples of access groups that you should consider would be Admin and Developer. Check out the [What makes a good access group strategy](/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup#accessgroup_strategy) best practices documentation. |
| - [ ] **Configure access groups for {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} and {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}}** | You can configure, control, and manage events and logging data that is available to users by configuring groups in the logging instance. Access groups provide extra security by allowing users to see only a subset of auditing events, as opposed to all auditing events that are generated in the account. For example, you might grant a group of users access to see auditing events that are only related to development services in the account. Learn more by reviewing [Using groups to control data access](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-group_data_access) and [RBAC, groups, and IAM integration](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-iam_grant_group). |
| - [ ] **Organize resource groups** | A resource group is a way for you to organize your account resources in customizable groupings so that you can quickly assign users access to multiple resources at a time. It is generally recommended to create a resource group per project. Learn more about [managing resource groups](/docs/account?topic=account-rgs). |
| - [ ] **Invite users to your account** | Users are invited to an account and given access to the resources. Use IAM to invite users, cancel invitations, or resend a pending invitation. You can invite a single user or multiple users. Start [inviting users to an account](/docs/account?topic=account-iamuserinv). |
| - [ ] **Set up trusted profiles** |  Trusted profiles are used to automatically grant federated users access to your account with conditions based on SAML attributes from your corporate directory. Trusted profiles can also be used to set up fine-grained authorization for applications that are running in compute resources. This way, you aren't required to create service IDs or API keys for the compute resources. Learn more about [creating trusted profiles](/docs/account?topic=account-create-trusted-profile). |
| - [ ] **Create service IDs** | A service ID identifies a service or application similar to how a user ID identifies a user. You can create a service ID and use it to enable an application outside of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} access to resources in your account. Learn more about [creating and working with service IDs](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceids&interface=ui). \n If you have configured a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance as described in [Encrypt and protect your data](#securing), you can use that instance to dynamically generate a service ID and an API key each time a protected resource is read or accessed. For more information, see [Creating IAM credentials](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials&interface=ui).  |
| - [ ] **Create API keys** | An API key is a unique code passed into an API to identify the calling application or user. You can use platform {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API keys that are associated with user identities, and you can create other API keys for service IDs. For more information, see [Understanding API keys](/docs/account?topic=account-manapikey). \n If you have configured a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance as described in [Encrypt and protect your data](#securing), you can use that instance to dynamically generate a service ID and an API key each time a protected resource is read or accessed. For more information, see [Creating IAM credentials](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials&interface=ui). |
| - [ ] **Learn about IAM policies** | A policy consists of a subject, target, and a role. A policy grants a subject one or multiple roles to a set of resources so that specific actions can be taken. The role defines the level of access that is granted. For more information, see [What are IAM policies and who can assign them?](/docs/account?topic=account-iamusermanpol) |
