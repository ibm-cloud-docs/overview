# What's a Customer Success Manager?
{: #csm}

An IBM Customer Success Manager (CSM) is a technical architect who works as part of your team to accelerate your time to value and help you achieve your business outcomes as you use IBM Software and IBM Cloud services.
{: shortdesc}

CSMs work with IBM customers to:

* Identify and implement use cases
* Review and co-create MVPs
* Design and validate solution architectures, enterprise account and user governance models
* Guide MVPs into production and scale with Business Partners, IBM Expert Labs, and IBM Consulting teams
* Optimize resource usage and cost management
* Review security and compliance requirements and implementations
* Ensure effective and efficient operational models

Additionally, CSMs[^note] engage product teams for roadmap previews, engage renewal teams for a seamless renewal process, provide demos for business and technical sponsors, help transfer knowledge of best practices, create integrated learning plans, and run business reviews to ensure alignment on outcomes.

At the end of the day, the CSM’s success is your success.
