Designed with secure engineering practices, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} platform provides layered security controls across network and infrastructure. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} focuses on protection across the entirety of the compute lifecycle, which includes everything from the build process and key management to the security of data services. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} also provides a group of security services that can be used by application developers to secure their mobile and web apps. These elements combine to make IBM Cloud a platform with clear choices for secure application development.

In addition to our own diligence in creating and operating a secure cloud, {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} also engages many different firms to assess the security and compliance of our cloud platform. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} compliance programs](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance) for a detailed list of certifications and attestations.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} ensures security readiness by adhering to security policies that are driven by best practices in {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} for systems, networking, and secure engineering. These policies include practices such as source code scanning, dynamic scanning, threat modeling, and penetration testing. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} follows the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) process for security incident management. See the [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Security Vulnerability Management (PSIRT)](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-security-vulnerability-management){: external} site for details.

In addition to the regular penetration testing conducted by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} and our partners, you can conduct penetration testing of your VPC or Classic Infrastructure resources on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Prior authorization to do so is not required by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} customers under an active NDA can request a copy of a penetration testing executive summary by [opening a support case](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter).

For more details about security for your applications and environments in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, see [IBM Security](https://www.ibm.com/security){: external}.
