{: release-note}

Securing your resources with context-based restrictions
:   You can now use context-based restrictions to configure and enforce access restrictions for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources. The access restrictions are based on the network location where an access request is created. These restrictions work in tandem with traditional IAM access policies, which are based on identity, to provide an extra layer of protection. Since both IAM access and context-based restrictions must enforce access, context-based restrictions offer protection even in the face of compromised or mismanaged credentials.

   You can create context-based restrictions by defining one or more network zones, which contain allowed network locations, and then associating the zones with the cloud resource through a context-based restrictions rule. Network zones can be defined in terms of IP address constructs, VPCs, and service references, which grant access to a resource from another cloud service.

   For more information, see [What are content-based restrictions?](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-whatis)

### 24 September 2021

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} enterprises for centrally managing multiple accounts
:   You can now centrally manage billing and usage for multiple accounts by creating an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} enterprise. With an enterprise, you can create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts by organizing related accounts into account groups. Enterprises simplify management of multiple accounts with the following key features:
   * Consolidated billing means that you can manage billing, invoicing, and payment for all accounts from a single place, the enterprise account.
   * Subscription credit is aggregated into a credit pool and shared with all accounts in the enterprise. Not only is tracking your subscriptions easier, but you can get fewer, larger subscriptions for a better discount because the credit is shared.
   * Top-down usage reporting gives you a unified view of usage costs from all accounts, organized according to your enterprise hierarchy.

   If you have multiple accounts, at least one of which is a Subscription account, you can create an enterprise. See [What is an enterprise?](/docs/account?topic=account-enterprise) and [Introducing IBM Cloud Enterprises](http://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/Introducing-IBM-Cloud-Enterprises){: external}  for more information.

Subscriptions page for tracking subscription credit spending

You can also view credit from any promotions in your account. For more information, see [Managing subscriptions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions).

Unified login, API keys, and user and access management
:   With our latest updates, you can take advantage of a simplified secure login that is available for all users regardless of your ID type. Whether you have an IBMid or a SoftLayer ID, you can quickly log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console from our enhanced login page. You can also make secure API calls across {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and automate your CLI login by using an IAM API key or an IAM access token.

   After you log in, you can now see all users, including platform and classic infrastructure users, from your Users page in the Access (IAM) UI. Depending on your access to view other users in the account, you can filter your view quickly by account users, classic infrastructure users, or Cloud Foundry org. You can also use the filters to find users quickly by name, email, or status.

   Now that all of your users are in a single console, you can manage their access to all types of resources from the same place. Access starts with the user, so start by selecting a user from your list. Then, depending on which type of resource that you want to assign access to, you can choose from IAM access policies, Cloud Foundry access, or classic infrastructure permissions. If you want to assign IAM access policies, try creating an access group to streamline your access management process by adding all users to the same access group that need the same policies assigned.

Organize your resources with tags
:   Tags are now available for you to add to your resources, like Cloud Object Storage, to help you manage resources and find the resources that are the most relevant to you. For example, if you have hundreds of resources and you want to differentiate between ones that are paid the same way, you could tag them with `costcenter:location01`. Or, if you have a team that is working on a couple of resources repeatedly, you can use something like `team-blue`. You can also filter the My resources page by tags to quickly organize and find the resources that you need. For more information, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag) and [Platform Tagging on the Enhanced {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Platform](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/platform-tagging-on-the-enhanced-ibm-cloud-platform){: external}.

Get accurate monthly costs with the cost estimator
:   To help you decide and analyze what services you'd like to purchase, you can use the cost estimator. Now, you can go through the console and select each service you'd like to have, and add all of the costs in an easy to use tool. You can even enter projected data usages, lookups per second, writes per second, and queries per second to get a more accurate estimation of your monthly expenditures. You can use the cost estimator with each catalog service you select, or you can click the Cost Estimator icon ![Cost Estimator icon](../icons/calculator.svg "Cost Estimator") in the console menu to get a summary of your estimated costs. For more information, see [Estimating your costs](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost).

Updated global location names
:   As {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} continues to expand our global availability footprint, we’re updating our location naming structure to better support an understandable, consistent hierarchy of geographies, regions, and data centers around the world. If you’re familiar with our current global regions, you’ll recognize names like US South and Sydney. We’re aligning these location names to the names of the city in which the data centers physically exist.

   For now, the programmatic IDs are not changing, so there’s no impact from an API perspective. The following table shows the old and new location names. For more information and a comprehensive list of data centers and regions, see [Service availability](/docs/overview?topic=overview-services_region).

   | Previous Location Display Name | New Location Display Name | Code     |

Assign account management access to others
:   With {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can delegate common tasks that you complete as an account administrator to another user in your account. By creating an access policy on one or all of the available account management services, you can easily delegate responsibilities such as inviting and removing users, managing access groups, managing service IDs, maintaining private catalog services, and even monitoring billing and tracking usage. There are four individual account management services and an all services option that you can use to set up access policies:
   * User Management for inviting and removing users
   * IAM Access Groups for creating, editing, deleting, updating, and assigning access
   * IAM Identity Service for viewing, creating, deleting, and assigning access to service IDs and associated API keys across the account
   * Global resource catalog for viewing private catalog offerings and updating the metadata and visibility for the offerings
   * All account management services for access to each of the individual account management service options based on the assigned role as well as access to billing and usage tracking.

   For more information on the tasks that a user can do based on which account management service they have a policy on and which role they are assigned, see [Example platform management roles and actions for account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#account-management-actions-roles). For more information about this new feature, see the [Introducing More Flexibility and Control for IBM Cloud Account Management Services Access](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/introducing-more-flexibility-and-control-for-ibm-cloud-account-management-services-access){: external} blog post.

Multi-factor authentication for your account
:   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring all users to provide a time-based one-time passcode in addition to their standard IBMid and password during login. This is also commonly known as two-factor authentication (2FA). MFA is enabled per account, and once it is turned on, all users in the account are required to log in by using the extra security measure.

A new way to organize resources within your account
:   Resource groups are a new way for you to create customizable groupings of account resources, and access to the group and the resources within it are managed by using Identity and Access Management (IAM). Everyone starts out with a default resource group. You can rename this resource group and add new service instances to it as you create them from the catalog.

   For users with a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can create extra resource groups to make managing quota and viewing billing usage for a set of resources easier. You can also group resources to make it easier for you to assign users access to more than one service at a time. To learn more about working with resource groups for your account, see [Managing resource groups](/docs/account?topic=account-rgs).

Updates for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM
:   The introduction of resource groups within your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account provides a new way for you to assign access. Users and service IDs can be assigned access to all services within a resource group, enabling you to quickly assign access to more than one resource at a time. You can also customize access for each user or service ID by assigning access to just some services within a resource group, or you choose to assign access to individual resources down to the service instance level. For more information about the features that you can take advantage of by using IAM, see [What features does IAM provide?](/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview#features)

Customize your dashboard view
:   You can view and manage all the resources in your account from your dashboard in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. And now, you can set filters to customize your view. For example, you can filter by resource group to view the specific resources in a resource group. You can also filter by region or Cloud Foundry space.
