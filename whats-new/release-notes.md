Carbon insights at the data center-level
:   Tracking carbon emissions at the data center-level helps you measure, analyze, and report the environment impact of your workloads with accuracy. By breaking down emissions at both the data center and regional levels, users gain deeper insights into where and how their workloads use energy. It enables more informed deployment decisions, better sustainability reporting, and improved alignment with global compliance standards. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} carbon calculator methodology](/docs/account?topic=account-what-is-cloud-calc&interface=ui#carbon-methodology).

{: #overview-august0825}
{: release-note}

Centralized IAM policy support for enterprise log routing
:   {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} now supports centralized IAM policies for enterprise-wide log routing. This enhancement enables enterprise customers to configure a single service-to-service authorization policy that allows log forwarding from multiple child accounts to a centralized logging instance, without the need to create individual policies for each account. For more information, see [Setting up centralized access to manage enterprise audit logs](/docs/enterprise-management?topic=enterprise-management-enterprise-access-management#enterprise-audit-logs).

### 07 August 2025
{: #overview-august0725}
{: release-note}

Federate enterprise IdP administrators to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using SAML
:   {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} now supports SAML-based identity federation directly through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM, enabling customers to federate identities from their external Identity Providers (IdPs) to manage {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. This enhancement helps ensure continuity for existing {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} integrations and provides a seamless path for onboarding to the new federation capability with minimal impact. For more information, see [Enabling authentication from an external identity provider](/docs/account?topic=account-ibm-idp-integration).

Stand-alone policy templates in IAM
:   IAM supports the creation of stand-alone policy templates. This capability enables enterprise administrators to define access rules independently, without linking them to an access group or trusted profile template. It centralizes policy management, reduces duplication, and simplifies applying consistent access rules across enterprise accounts. For more information, see [Creating a stand-alone policy template](/docs/enterprise-management?topic=enterprise-management-policy-template-create&interface=ui#create-standalone-policytemplate-ui).

Generate a report on the MFA status of account users
:   Users that don't meet MFA requirements leave your account vulnerable. You can now identify the users in your account that don't satisfy your MFA requirements. For more information, see [Identifying a user's MFA status](/docs/account?topic=account-id-user-mfa).

An extra layer of security for users that don't use MFA
:   {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} recommends enabling multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users in your account, but some automation scenarios might require you to exclude specific users from your MFA requirement. For users that are excluded from MFA, you can make access more secure by disabling CLI logins with only a username and password. This way, you require an API key to log in to the CLI or users can log in with `--sso`. For more information, see [Disabling MFA](/docs/account?topic=account-enablemfa#disablemfa).

Time-based conditions in IAM access policies
:   {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM is excited to give customers the ability to set access controls based on a specified time and date. You can now create policies that grant employees access to a resource during only their working hours, or grant automated processes temporary access for a specified duration. Implementing such limitations helps you to apply the principle of least privilege for assigning access and reduces the opportunity for attack in the event of a security breach. For more information, see [Limiting access with time-based conditions](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-time-based&interface=ui).

IAM Policy Management API V2 release
:   A new version (`v2`) of the IAM Policy Management API is now available. This version adds a new JSON schema to support a conditional policy construct and several time-based comparison operators.
