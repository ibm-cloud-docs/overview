Securing your resources with context-based restrictions
:   You can now use context-based restrictions to configure and enforce access restrictions for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources. The access restrictions are based on the network location where an access request is created. These restrictions work in tandem with traditional IAM access policies, which are based on identity, to provide an extra layer of protection. Since both IAM access and context-based restrictions must enforce access, context-based restrictions offer protection even in the face of compromised or mismanaged credentials.

   You can create context-based restrictions by defining one or more network zones, which contain allowed network locations, and then associating the zones with the cloud resource through a context-based restrictions rule. Network zones can be defined in terms of IP address constructs, VPCs, and service references, which grant access to a resource from another cloud service.

Upcoming changes to the user invitation flow
:   Starting June 01 2021, to enhance security and user protection, all users will be required to accept an invitation to become an active user within a new account. The new invitation flow will have an impact only on inviting existing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} users. Existing users are currently being automatically onboarded to each new account as they are invited. After this change, these users will need to accept an invitation in their notifications, by email, or by using the CLI to onboard to a new account.

   Concerned about how this change will impact your automation? To avoid any disruption to on-going workflows, you need to check your scripts:

   * To accept invitations in the CLI, existing members of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} must use the [**`ibmcloud login`**](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#ibmcloud_login) command. They need to target the account that they are invited to join and use the new `--accept` flag.

   As an account administrator, you may want to remind your users to accept these invitations upon initial change of this behavior.

Term-based model for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support subscriptions
:   New subscriptions for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support now follow the same term-based model as subscriptions for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform services. Rather than credit being valid in monthly increments, credit is now available up front for an entire subscription term, which can be up to one year's worth of credit. You now have more flexibility to use your support credit when you need it, and the chances of incurring monthly overages are reduced. When you buy or renew a support subscription, any existing active support subscriptions are converted to this new flexible model for the remainder of their term. For more information, see [Support subscriptions](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#support-subscriptions).

   You can also now view your support subscriptions in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console so you can keep track of your available credit. For more information, see [Viewing your support costs](/docs/account?topic=account-support).

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} enterprises for centrally managing multiple accounts
:   You can now centrally manage billing and usage for multiple accounts by creating an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} enterprise. With an enterprise, you can create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts by organizing related accounts into account groups. Enterprises simplify management of multiple accounts with the following key features:
   * Consolidated billing means that you can manage billing, invoicing, and payment for all accounts from a single place, the enterprise account.
   * Subscription credit is aggregated into a credit pool and shared with all accounts in the enterprise. Not only is tracking your subscriptions easier, but you can get fewer, larger subscriptions for a better discount because the credit is shared.
   * Top-down usage reporting gives you a unified view of usage costs from all accounts, organized according to your enterprise hierarchy.

   If you have multiple accounts, at least one of which is a Subscription account, you can create an enterprise. See [What is an enterprise?](/docs/enterprise-management?topic=enterprise-management-what-is-enterprise) and [Introducing IBM Cloud Enterprises](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/introducing-ibm-cloud-enterprises/){: external}  for more information.

Subscriptions page for tracking subscription credit spending
:   If you have a Subscription account, you can now view all of your subscriptions and analyze your credit spending on the Subscriptions page. You get a high-level view of the total subscription credit in your account and detailed charts that visualize trends such as your credit burndown and monthly spending. You can also view credit from any promotions in your account. For more information, see [Managing subscriptions](/docs/account?topic=account-subscriptions).

   Additionally, to better reflect their usage, codes that you apply to add subscription credit to your account are now called subscription codes rather than feature codes.

Unified login, API keys, and user and access management
:   With our latest updates, you can take advantage of a simplified secure login that is available for all users regardless of your ID type. Whether you have an IBMid or a SoftLayer ID, you can quickly log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console from our enhanced login page. You can also make secure API calls across {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and automate your CLI login by using an IAM API key or an IAM access token.

   After you log in, you can now see all users, including platform and classic infrastructure users, from your Users page in the Access (IAM) UI. Depending on your access to view other users in the account, you can filter your view quickly by account users, classic infrastructure users, or Cloud Foundry org. You can also use the filters to find users quickly by name, email, or status.

   Now that all of your users are in a single console, you can manage their access to all types of resources from the same place. Access starts with the user, so start by selecting a user from your list. Then, depending on which type of resource that you want to assign access to, you can choose from IAM access policies, Cloud Foundry access, or classic infrastructure permissions. If you want to assign IAM access policies, try creating an access group to streamline your access management process by adding all users to the same access group that need the same policies assigned.

New dashboard and Resource list page
:   With our latest update, you can now view all your platform and infrastructure services from one location. When you log in, you can check out the new dashboard. After you add resources to your account from the catalog, you can use your resource list to get a full view of your account resources:
   * The dashboard is redesigned so that you can view a summary your resources, maintenance, status, apps, support, usage, and users.
   * You can find more details about your resources by going to your resource list. You can tag your resources to organize them, or select them to update the details page.
   * Now that you can see all of your resources in one place, we added a global search so that you can quickly find resources that you created and expect to find in your resource list.
   * You can also search for catalog results, so you can quickly find resources to add to your account.

Unified account, billing, and user profile information
:   Your account, billing, and profile information is now simplified. You can view your account information for all of your platform and infrastructure resources in a unified console.
:   Your profile and settings area contains information about you as well as your email notification preferences for all resource types.
:   Your account information area contains information about your company or organization, account settings, and quick access for working with resource groups and Cloud Foundry orgs. You can even find best practices to help you get up and running quickly!

   Check out [Bringing It All Together: A Single Account and Billing Management Experience](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ibm-cloud-account-management/){: external} for more details.

Organize your resources with tags
:   Tags are now available for you to add to your resources, like Cloud Object Storage, to help you manage resources and find the resources that are the most relevant to you. For example, if you have hundreds of resources and you want to differentiate between ones that are paid the same way, you could tag them with `costcenter:location01`. Or, if you have a team that is working on a couple of resources repeatedly, you can use something like `team-blue`. You can also filter the My resources page by tags to quickly organize and find the resources that you need. For more information, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag) and [Platform Tagging on the Enhanced {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Platform](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/platform-tagging-on-the-enhanced-ibm-cloud-platform/){: external}.

Get accurate monthly costs with the cost estimator
:   To help you decide and analyze what services you'd like to purchase, you can use the cost estimator. Now, you can go through the console and select each service you'd like to have, and add all of the costs in an easy to use tool. You can even enter projected data usages, lookups per second, writes per second, and queries per second to get a more accurate estimation of your monthly expenditures. You can use the cost estimator with each catalog service you select, or you can click the Cost Estimator icon ![Cost Estimator icon](../icons/calculator.svg "Cost Estimator") in the console menu to get a summary of your estimated costs.

Assign account management access to others
:   With {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can delegate common tasks that you complete as an account administrator to another user in your account. By creating an access policy on one or all of the available account management services, you can easily delegate responsibilities such as inviting and removing users, managing access groups, managing service IDs, maintaining private catalog services, and even monitoring billing and tracking usage. There are four individual account management services and an all services option that you can use to set up access policies:
   * User Management for inviting and removing users
   * IAM Access Groups for creating, editing, deleting, updating, and assigning access
   * IAM Identity Service for viewing, creating, deleting, and assigning access to service IDs and associated API keys across the account
   * Global resource catalog for viewing private catalog offerings and updating the metadata and visibility for the offerings
   * All account management services for access to each of the individual account management service options based on the assigned role as well as access to billing and usage tracking.

   For more information on the tasks that a user can do based on which account management service they have a policy on and which role they are assigned, see [Example platform management roles and actions for account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services&interface=ui#all-account-management).

A new way to organize resources within your account
:   Resource groups are a new way for you to create customizable groupings of account resources, and access to the group and the resources within it are managed by using Identity and Access Management (IAM). Everyone starts out with a default resource group. You can rename this resource group and add new service instances to it as you create them from the catalog.

   For users with a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can create extra resource groups to make managing quota and viewing billing usage for a set of resources easier. You can also group resources to make it easier for you to assign users access to more than one service at a time.

Users and service IDs can be assigned access to all services within a resource group, enabling you to quickly assign access to more than one resource at a time. You can also customize access for each user or service ID by assigning access to just some services within a resource group, or you choose to assign access to individual resources down to the service instance level. For more information about the features that you can take advantage of by using IAM, see [What features does IAM provide?](/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview#features)

Customize your dashboard view
:   You can view and manage all the resources in your account from your dashboard in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. And now, you can set filters to customize your view. For example, you can filter by resource group to view the specific resources in a resource group. You can also filter by region or Cloud Foundry space.

Identity and Access Management application authentication feature
:   Identity and Access Management (IAM) now supports service IDs, which you can think of as identities that can be used for apps to authenticate with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services. Instead of using individual user credentials, a Service ID can be created with an associated API key and access permissions in the form of a service policy that is assigned to the Service ID in order for you to control the level of access for any application authenticating with that ID.

   For more information about the benefits of this feature and how to get started, see the [Introducing IBM Cloud IAM Service IDs and API Keys](https://www.ibm.com/blog/introducing-ibm-cloud-iam-service-ids-api-keys/){: external}.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} global catalog
:   Expanding on the last console update to manage your public regions from a single location in the console, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} now has a global catalog, making the process of selecting and deploying items that you select from the catalog a more streamlined process. Regardless of the region that you select in the console, you can now see all services that are available across all public regions from your catalog. Once you select a tile from the catalog, you can see which regions the service is available in, and select where you want to deploy it. For more information about the latest updates to the catalog, see [A global {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog makes building things easier](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/global-bluemix-catalog-makes-building-things-easier/){: external}.

Identity and access management
:   With the latest updates and improvements, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account owners or administrators can now use a new unified access control UI to take advantage of the following capabilities:
   * Manage users' fine-grained access to Kubernetes services and other services as they adopt the new access control features
   * Assign service policies and Cloud Foundry roles to users within their organizations

   Additionally, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform users can create, delete, and list API keys associated with their user IDs. And platform users can use those API keys to authenticate when using APIs or CLIs.

   Lastly, we enhanced our unified user management capability to ensure that in a linked IaaS-PaaS account, users are managed in a unified way with no need to add users separately in the SoftLayer Customer Portal or the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}console.
